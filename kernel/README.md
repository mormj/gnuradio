# GNU Radio Kernel Library

The kernel library is intended to contain all the standalone signal processing objects that blocks can wrap.  This library should be lightweight with no dependencies with the intent that the main signal processing code from blocks can reside here.

## Licensing

The kernel code and anything that links to it, as it originated from GNU Radio v3 and prior is licensed as GPL v3
